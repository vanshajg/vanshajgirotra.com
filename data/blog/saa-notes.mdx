I just got my Solutions Architect Associate certification and made these notes while studying. Hope they help you out!

# IAM

### Policy

IAM policies define permissions for AWS resources. These policies determine what actions are allowed or denied on those resources. It's crucial to have well-defined policies to control access effectively and securely.

### Role

Roles are a preferred method from a security perspective for granting temporary permissions to users, applications, or services. Roles are assumed, not attached to IAM users or groups, which reduces the risk of long-term access.

### Group

Groups are used to organize IAM users and apply permissions to multiple users at once. However, it's generally recommended to use roles for granting permissions over groups to reduce the potential for excessive access.

### IAM Federation

IAM federation allows users to use the same credentials as their PC when they use Windows Active Directory. This integration enhances security by centralizing user authentication and reducing the need for separate IAM credentials.

### Identity Federation

Identity federation is achieved using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standard, which integrates with Active Directory (AD). This standardizes the authentication process and allows for single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, improving user experience and security.

### Security Groups

Security groups are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources. In this setup:

- All inbound traffic is blocked by default, which is a security best practice. This means that resources are inaccessible until explicitly allowed.
- All outbound traffic is allowed, which can be convenient for most use cases. However, organizations should monitor outbound traffic to ensure security and compliance.

These policies and configurations are designed to enhance security and access management within your organization, following best practices and standards.

# S3

- Not suitable for OS/DB storage.
- Files can be up to 5TB in size.
- Bucket names should be unique across AWS.
- Buckets are private by default.

You can control public access at the object level by using **object ACLs** and at the bucket level by **bucket policies**.

S3 can be used to host static content, and it automatically scales.

## Versioning

- All versions are stored in S3, including writes and deletes.
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled; it can only be suspended.
- It can be used with lifecycle rules.
- It also supports MFA.

| Storage Class                   | Availability and Durability | AZ(s) | Use case                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S3 Standard                     | 99.99%, 11 9s               | >=3   | Most workloads                                                                                |
| S3 Standard - Infrequent Access | 99.99%, 11 9s               | >=3   | Long-term, infrequently accessed critical data (backup, data store for data recovery)         |
| S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access | 99.5%, 11 9s                | 1     | Long-term, infrequently accessed, non-critical data                                           |
| S3 Glacier/Flexible Retrieval   | 99.99%, 11 9s               | >=3   | Long-term data that occasionally needs to be accessed within a few minutes or hours           |
| S3 Glacier Deep Archive         | 99.99%, 11 9s               | >=3   | Rarely accessed data with a retrieval time of 12 hours (e.g., financial data for regulations) |
| S3 Intelligent Tiering          | 99.9%, 11 9s                | >=3   | Uses ML, unknown or unpredictable access patterns                                             |
| S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval    |                             |       | Milliseconds retrieval, rarely accessed, lowest long-term storage                             |

## Lifecycle Management

Automates the movement between different storage tiers. Can be used in conjunction with versioning and can be applied to current and previous versions as well.

## S3 Object Lock

- It uses the **Write once and read many (WORM)** model to store data.
- Object lock can be applied to an object or across the bucket itself.
- Two modes:
  1. Governance mode: Users aren't able to overwrite or delete an object version or alter its settings unless they have specific permissions.
  2. Compliance mode: Protected object that cannot be overwritten or deleted even by the root user.

## Glacier Vault Lock

Enforces compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults (WORM).

## Encryption

**In Transit:**

- HTTPS
- SSL/TLS

**Encryption at Rest (SSE):**

- Server-side encryption
  - SSE-S3
  - SSE-KMS
    - Take care of KMS quota; limits are region-specific from 5500 to 3000 RPS.
  - SSE-C

Client-side encryption

You can enforce SSE with a bucket policy that denies any PUT request that doesn't contain the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header.

## Prefixes

For an object like `mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/hello.jpeg`, the prefix is `folder1/subfolder1`.
We can achieve 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE requests and 5500 GET/HEAD per prefix.
It's better to spread objects across different prefixes to maximize performance.

## Optimizing S3 Uploads and Downloads

1. Use multipart upload when uploading to S3; it should be used for any file over 100MB and must be used for any file over 5GB.
2. Use S3 byte-range fetches to increase the performance of downloading (splits the file into multiple chunks and downloads in parallel).

## S3 Replication

You can use it to replicate objects from one bucket to another. Objects in the existing bucket are not replicated automatically, and delete markers are not replicated by default.

# EC2

## Pricing Options

1. **On demand**: Pay by the hour or second depending on the instance we run. It's great for flexibility.
2. **Spot**: Purchase unused capacity at a discount (up to 90%). Prices can fluctuate based on demand. It's great for applications with flexible start and end times.
3. **Reserved**: Reserved capacity for 1 or 3 years. Up to 72% discount on hourly charge and is great for known and fixed requirements.
4. **Dedicated**: Physical EC2 server dedicated for our use. Great if we have server-bound licenses to reuse or compliance requirements.

## Bootstrap Script

A script that runs when the instance first runs. It can be used to install applications and to do updates.

## Networking Devices

1. **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**: Virtual network card for EC2. Its purpose is to enable network connectivity for instances. A single instance can attach multiple ENIs allowing communication in multiple subnets.
2. **Enhanced Network Adapter (EFA)**: For high throughput. 10GBPS - 100GBPS.
3. **Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)**: Network devices that accelerate high-performance computing and machine learning. They are EFAs with OS level bypass.

## Placement Groups

1. **Cluster Placement Groups**: Low network latency and high throughput. Cannot span multiple AZ.
2. **Spread Placement Groups**: Strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures. Can span multiple AZ.
3. **Partition Placement Groups**: Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. Can be used for distributed workloads like Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka. Can span multiple AZ.

## vCenter

Used to deploy VMware vCentre on AWS and extends ability with hybrid cloud.

## Outposts

It is used to extend AWS to own data center. **AWS Outposts Rack** is for large deployments (own data center) and **AWS Outpost Servers** are for small deployments where there are space constraints (retail/factory store).

---

# EBS

Persistent storage for EC2 instances. It has two types:

## SSD

1. **gp2**: Suitable for boot disks and general apps. Up to 16K IOPS/volume.
2. **gp3**: Suitable for high-performance applications. 3K IOPS baseline.
3. **io1**: Suitable for OLTP and latency-sensitive applications. 64k high performance and most expensive.
4. **io2**: Suitable for OLTP, most durable among all. Latest-gen provisioned IOPS volume.

## HDD

1. **st1**: Suitable for big data, data warehouses, ETL. Cannot be a boot volume.
2. **sc1**: Suitable for less frequently accessed data. Cannot be a boot volume.

## Volumes and Snapshots

Volumes exist on EBS, and snapshots exist on S3. Snapshots are point-in-time photos of EBS volumes and are incremental. So the first snapshot might take some time to generate. Snapshots can be shared across regions but first they need to be copied to that region.

## Instance Store

Also called ephemeral storage. It's a physical drive attached to the instance. If the instance is terminated, you will lose that data as compared to EBS.

**How to encrypt existing volumes:**

1. Create snapshot.
2. Encrypt snapshot.
3. Create AMI from snapshot.
4. Launch instance from AMI.

## EC2 Hibernation

Preserves the in-memory RAM to EBS. Instance RAM must be less than 150GB, and instances cannot be hibernated for more than 60 days. Available for on-demand and reserved instances.

## Elastic File System

### EFS

Supports NFS protocol and only pay for what you use. Has read-after-write consistency. Data is stored across multiple AZ. Used for Linux instances and Linux-based applications.

### Amazon FSx for Windows

Centralized storage for Windows-based applications.

### Amazon FSx for Lustre

High-speed and high-capacity distributed storage. It's used for applications that do high-performance computing, financial modeling. **It can store data directly to S3.**

## AWS Backup

A single pane of glass to back up services like EC2, EBS, EFS, FSx for Lustre, FSx for Windows, and Storage Gateway. We can use organizations to back up AWS services across multiple AWS accounts. Used for better compliance and enforcing backup policies.

---

# Databases

## RDS

Database types: SQL Server, Oracle, Aurora, etc. It's used for OLTP workloads where there are small transactions.

## Multi AZ vs Read Replicas

**Multi AZ**:

- An exact copy of the production database is in another AZ. It's used for disaster recovery. Aurora automatically fails over to the standby instance in case of failure.

**Read Replicas**:

- Read-only copy of the primary DB in the same AZ, cross AZ, or cross-region. It's used to increase read performance. Great for read-heavy workloads.

## Aurora

Highly durable. It has 2 copies in each AZ in a minimum of 3 AZs. We can share Aurora snapshots with other AWS accounts. Automated failover is only available with Aurora replicas. It has automatic backup enabled by default.

### Aurora Serverless

Relatively simple, cost-effective option for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads.

## DynamoDB

NoSQL-based DB, stored on SSD storage. It's spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers.
It's eventually consistent (~1s) by default. It can also be configured to be strongly consistent.

### DynamoDB Transactions

Multiple all-or-nothing operations which can be used in financial transactions. 3 options for reads: eventual consistency, strong consistency, and transactional. **For ACID requirements**.

### On-Demand Backup and Restore

Full backup at any time, and it has zero impact on table performance.

### Point-in-Time Recovery

Incremental backup which protects against accidental writes and deletes. It can restore up to 35 days before. It's not enabled by default. Last restorable: 5 minutes in the past.

### DynamoDB Streams

Time-ordered sequence of item-level changes in a table. Stored for 24 hours. Stores inserts, updates, and deletes. It can be combined with Lambda.

### Global Tables

Managed multi-master, multi-region replication. It's used for globally distributed applications, based on DynamoDB streams. Used to add redundancy to DynamoDB.

## DocumentDB

Used to run MongoDB compatible databases.

## AWS Keyspaces

Used to run Cassandra on AWS.

## AWS Neptune

Graph-based database.

## QLDB

Quantum Ledger Database. Immutable database.

## Timestream

Used to store time series data for analysis.

---

# VPC

VPC can be thought of as a logical data center in AWS. It consists of subnets, gateways, route tables, network ACLs, and security groups.

When you create a VPC, AWS creates a security group, network ACL, and route table by default.

### NAT Gateways

They are used to provide internet access to instances in private subnets so that internet traffic cannot route directly to the instances. For high availability, use different NAT gateways for instances in different AZs.

### Network ACLs

They are the first line of defense for controlling traffic into a subnet. They are stateless, meaning you would have to create rules for both inbound and outbound traffic to allow traffic for a particular type. **Security groups are stateful**. One NACL can be attached to multiple subnets, but a subnet can only have one NACL. Inbound and outbound traffic is enabled by default in the default NACL, while it's the opposite in custom NACL. **NACLs are used to block IP addresses**. They consist of rules and start with the lowest number first.

### VPC Endpoints

They are like NAT gateways but are used to facilitate communication between services in the VPC and services in AWS so that the packet doesn't leave the AWS infrastructure. There are two types: interface endpoint and gateway endpoint, for services like S3 and DynamoDB.

### Peering

Connection of two VPCs so that services inside can talk over private IPs. Cross-account VPCs can be connected as well. Peering cannot be transitive, and CIDR ranges cannot overlap.

### Privatelink

Used to share an application in a VPC with many other VPCs. This only shares that particular app and not the whole network like in peering relationships. Requires NLB on the service VPC and ENI on the customer VPC.

### VPN Cloud-Hub

Used to connect different VPN connections to each other.

### Direct Connect

Used to connect a data center to AWS, increasing network reliability and throughput as the packets travel through the AWS backbone network. Helpful when a stable and reliable connection is required.

### Transit Gateway

Used to simplify network topology and use transitive peering, unlike the peering mentioned above. Route tables can be used to control which VPCs can communicate with others.

### VPN Hub

Used to simplify VPN network topology.

### AWS Wavelength

Used to increase application speed at the edge using 5G.

---

# Route 53

**TLD**: Top Level Domain name. For example, "com" in google.com, or "uk" in bbc.co.uk.
**NameServer**: Server that contains our domain record (A record, MX, CNAME).

**A record**: Address record. Mapping of name to IP.

**CNAME**: Canonical Name. Used to resolve one domain name to another.

**Alias records**: Specific to (AWS) Route 53. These are similar to CNAME and are used to map one record to LBs, CloudFront distributions, or S3 buckets. This can map naked domains (example.com to services), but this is not possible with CNAME.

**NS**: Nameserver records.

**SOA**: Start of Authority.

**Health check** is used to validate if a record is working properly. If a record fails, it is automatically removed from the options. It can also be used for SNS notification.

### Routing Policies

**Simple**: Returns multiple IP addresses in random order.
**Weighted**: Sends a percentage of traffic. Supports health checks.
**Geolocation**: Routes based on where the end user is located.
**Geo-proximity**: Similar to geolocation. Also has bias which shrinks or expands a geographic region (uses traffic flow GUI).
**Latency** based routing: Chooses the fastest region for the user.
**Failover**: Has an active-passive setup. Has health checks on regions and automatically switches regions on failure.
**Multi-value answer routing**: Simple routing with health checks.

---

# ELB

Helps balance load across multiple EC2 instances. There are 3 types:

1. Application Load Balancer (ALB): On layer 7. Best suited for HTTP(S) traffic.
2. Network Load Balancer (NLB): On layer 4. For performance.
3. Classic Load Balancer (CLB): Not recommended to use. Layer 4/7.

### Health Checks

Used to route traffic to instances that are healthy.

### Application Load Balancer

This is on layer 7.

**Listeners**: Listener checks for connection requests for the port and protocol.

**Rules**: Used to route requests to a particular target group. Can use path / IP / headers, etc.

**Target Groups**: Set of one or more targets (e.g., EC2) and has health checks in it.

### Network Load Balancer

This is on layer 4 and is used for performance. Sometimes used when other protocols are needed which are not supported by ALB. NLB can decrypt traffic, but it needs a certificate to be installed.

### Classic Load Balancer

Level 4 / Level 7.

504 Gateway Timeout means that the application is not responding and got timeout. CLB is working though. `X-forwarded-for` header is used to check the IP address of the end-user.

### Sticky Sessions

Are used to send users to a specific EC2 for CLB and target group for ALB. A use case is when the instance is storing data locally.

### Deregistration Delay / Connection Draining

Keeps existing connections open in the case when instances are unhealthy. If this setting is disabled, then the LB will close the connection to the instances as soon as the target group / instance is deregistering / unhealthy.

---

# CloudWatch

CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability platform for AWS infrastructure.

- **System metrics**: Monitor metrics like CPU utilization, etc.
- **Application metrics**: Check at the application level, like whether a server process is running.
- **Alarms using filter patterns**.

It operates in two modes:

- **Standard**: Data is delivered every 5 minutes.
- **Detailed**: Data is delivered every 1 minute.

**Note**: It's not suitable for real-time logging.

### CloudWatch Logs

It's a tool to help monitor, store, and access log files from different sources. It also has the ability to query logs to identify potential issues.

- **Log event**: A single log record.
- **Log stream**: A collection of log events from the same source.
- **Log group**: A collection of log streams.

#### CloudWatch Log Insights

This feature allows you to query all logs using SQL-like commands in one place.

- **Amazon Managed Grafana**: Visualization tool.
- **Amazon Managed Prometheus**: Get container metrics like EKS cluster datapoints.

---

# High Availability and Scaling

Types of scaling:

- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing the capacity of a single instance by adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or storage.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Increasing the capacity by adding more instances to distribute the load across multiple machines.

3 W's of scaling:

- **What**: What component of the infrastructure do we scale? For example, EC2 instances, database servers, or VPC resources. Additionally, where do we source the scaling template or configuration?
- **Where**: In which region or availability zone are the resources being scaled? This is crucial for distributing the workload effectively and ensuring high availability.
- **When**: What triggers the scaling action? This could be based on metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom application-specific metrics monitored by CloudWatch.

### Launch Templates vs Configurations:

**Launch Templates** are flexible and version-controlled templates used for creating EC2 instances. They allow specifying various instance attributes such as AMI, instance type, security groups, and block device mappings.

**Configurations**, on the other hand, are used specifically for auto-scaling groups and provide a limited set of configuration options. They are immutable and suitable for defining scaling policies but lack the flexibility and version control of launch templates.

### Auto Scaling Group

An **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** manages a collection of EC2 instances, automatically adjusting the number of instances in response to changing demand. It ensures that the desired number of instances are running to handle the workload efficiently while maintaining high availability and reliability.

**Steady State Groups** maintain a constant number of instances, typically used for legacy applications that require a single instance to remain available at all times.

## Scaling:

- **Warmup**: Ensures that newly launched instances are ready to handle traffic before being added to the load balancer, preventing potential issues during the scaling process.
- **Cooldown**: A period during which auto-scaling activities are suspended to allow the system to stabilize after a scaling action. This prevents rapid fluctuations in instance counts.
- **Avoid Thrashing**: Gradually add or remove instances to prevent rapid fluctuations, which can impact system performance and stability.

### Scaling Types:

- **Reactive Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the capacity based on current demand, scaling up or down in response to changing workload patterns.
- **Scheduled Scaling**: Pre-defined scaling actions triggered at specific times or dates, useful for handling predictable changes in workload such as daily or weekly spikes.
- **Predictive Scaling**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast future demand and proactively adjust capacity, optimizing resource utilization and cost efficiency.

### Scaling RDS

Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of an RDS instance by upgrading to a larger instance type with more CPU, memory, or storage resources.

Horizontal scaling is achieved through features such as **Read Replicas** for distributing read traffic and **Aurora Serverless** for automatically adjusting capacity based on demand.

#### Scaling Non-relational Databases

- **Provisioned**: Pre-allocated capacity suitable for predictable workloads where performance requirements are known in advance.
- **On-demand**: Dynamically adjusts capacity based on demand, paying only for the resources consumed. Ideal for unpredictable or fluctuating workloads.

# Decoupling Workloads

## SQS (Simple Queue Service)

- Poll-based service
- Queue-based service where messages are expired after some time
- Supports long and short polling
- **Visibility Timeout**: When a consumer reads a message, SQS puts a lock on the message until confirmation or timeout. The developer must make a delete API call.
- Max message size is 256KB.

### Dead Letter Queue

- Prevents retries from happening repeatedly by moving messages to a secondary queue.
- It's important to set CloudWatch alarms.

### Message Ordering and Duplication

- SQS by default has best-case ordering, meaning that messages sent to the queue might be jumbled, and duplication is possible.
- SQS FIFO solves these problems, but there is a caveat that there will be at most 300 message transactions per second.

## SNS (Simple Notification Service)

- Push-based message service that sends notifications to subscribers as soon as a message is received.
- Subscribers include Kinesis Firehose, SQS, email, and HTTPS.
- Also has dead letter queue support.

## Application Gateway

- Manages API endpoints, prevents DDoS attacks, and supports API versioning.

### AWS Batch

- AWS-managed job processing (computing) service.
- Suitable for long-running (> 15 min) and event-driven workloads.
- Difference from Lambda: Lambda is fully serverless but requires a specific runtime, while Batch uses Docker, allowing it to be run in any environment.

### Amazon MQ

- Supports one-to-one (queue) and one-to-many (topic) communication.
- A managed solution for migrating apps using message brokers.

### AWS Step Functions

- Serverless orchestration service that lets developers create and manage multi-step application workflows in the cloud.
- Uses a drag-and-drop visual editor for assembling individual microservices into unified workflows.
- Manages input, output, error handling, and retries at each step of a workflow.

### Appflow

- Helps transfer bi-directional data from third-party SaaS applications to Amazon and store it, potentially in S3.

- **Data Firehose**: Transfers data to destinations like S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, or Splunk, nearly in real-time. Automatically scales and is plug-and-play with AWS architecture.

### Why Kinesis over SQS for message brokering:

- **SQS**: Simpler, doesn't require much configuration, but lacks real-time message delivery.
- **Kinesis**: More complex to configure, mainly used in big data applications, offers real-time communication.

**Kinesis Data Analytics**: Transforms and processes data in a stream using SQL.

## Athena

- Serverless platform for analyzing data in S3 using SQL queries without loading into a database.

## Glue

- Serverless ETL service for discovering, preparing, and combining data. Can replace EMR.

## Quicksight

- Data visualization tool sitting atop Athena.

## AWS Data Pipeline

- Managed ETL service for automating data movement and transformation.
- Uses data-driven workflows to create dependencies between tasks and activities.

## Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka)

- Fully managed Kafka service, handling cluster management, integration with KMS for encryption, and TLS for in-transit security.

## OpenSearch

- Used to run search and analytics engines for various use cases.
- Successor to Amazon Elasticsearch Service, ingests logs from various sources, performs analytics, and outputs to other services.

# Serverless

In a nutshell, serverless computing allows developers to focus solely on writing code while leaving the management of compute infrastructure (OS) to the cloud provider. It operates on an event-driven model and follows a pure pay-as-you-go pricing model.

## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that enables running code without managing the underlying architecture. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

- **Runtime**: Developers can choose from available runtimes or build their own custom runtimes.
- **Permissions**: Lambda functions can be attached to roles to grant necessary permissions for AWS API calls.
- **Networking**: Lambda functions may need to reside within a VPC if they interact with resources like RDS within the same VPC, although they can also run outside a VPC.
- **Resources**: Lambda functions have access to CPU and memory resources, and developers can specify these configurations.
- **Triggers**: Lambda functions are triggered based on events such as API calls, file uploads, or scheduled tasks.

AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) templates are CloudFormation templates that define Lambda functions and other serverless resources. These templates facilitate the publishing and deployment of Lambda functions.

## Container Management with ECS and EKS

ECS (Elastic Container Service) and EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) are AWS's proprietary container management services.

# Caching

Caching plays a crucial role in optimizing performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the user or application, reducing latency and improving response times. There are two main types of caching:

1. **External Caching**: This involves caching content at the edge of the network, typically using a content delivery network (CDN) like CloudFront. CDNs cache static content such as images, videos, and web pages, reducing the load on origin servers and improving delivery speeds to end users.

2. **Internal Caching**: This involves caching data within the application or infrastructure, often to optimize database queries or frequently accessed data. Services like ElastiCache and DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) provide managed caching solutions for this purpose.
